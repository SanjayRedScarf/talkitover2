####### TODO TODO TODO ###################################
## Implement a separate css class for confidential text
## Maybe consider having a button which the user can press to say "you didn't understand me"
## Instead of the user's response being a dropdown, change it to a button so that it can be sized appropriately (i.e. not be tiny on a mobile screen)
## Correct the current bug: currently the system won't choose responses correctly if multiple users in parallel (or even in series)
## Do a refactor (maybe use more object oriented programming????)
## One thing to refactor: all the blahblahAlreadyUsed variables could be replaced with a dict?
## Currently have hardcoded "if section == 11" statements. replace these by having a variable for "numberOfInitialSections" = 10. Make sure it's global. If the user's first message is "hello", then increment the number of initial sections variable
## Stop button sometimes gets hit the moment it appears. Current fix is to add some wording; could consider something better?
## ADD IN WILDCARD BETWEEN "ITS NOT THAT" AND "STRING" WHERE APPLICABLE
## ADD IN SOMETHING FOR "YOU ARE NOT HELPING" OR "THIS IS NOT HELPING" OR "YOU ARE USELESS"
## Rules around selfharm / DSH / cutting -- this is still a gap
## Rules for relationships -- this comes up a lot, and I currently can't think of something good to say
## Rule for pandemic/corona/covid
## Longer term: would be great to be able to summarise back what the user has said (but this is hard!)
